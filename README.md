# Calibration of an SEIR Model and applications to CEA
This project contains one script divided in two sections, Calibration of an SEIR model and Application to Economic Analysis. The former shows all steps needed to conduct a calibration using a direct search algorithm from data simulation to obtaining posterior distributions for the parameters of interest. The latter presents functions to implement a cost-effectiveness analysis using the results from the ODE and simulated interventions. All data is simulated and generated within the same script.
